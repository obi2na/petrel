# 🐧 Petrel – The Control Plane for AI-Generated Content

**Petrel** helps non-technical teams adopt generative AI safely, collaboratively, and at scale.  
It connects AI agents (like GPT, Claude, or your own internal models) to your publishing destinations (Notion, Confluence, Slack, GitHub, etc.) and adds the structure, transparency, and governance that real teams need.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 **AI Agent Marketplace**  
  Subscribe to GPT or Claude, or bring your own AI agents (including AnythingLLM and Palmyra).

- 💬 **Unified Chat + Draft Interface**  
  Collaborate with AI agents through structured, traceable chat sessions linked to drafts.

- 👥 **Multi-User Collaboration**  
  Multiple teammates can contribute to the same draft using their own AI agents — with separate chat histories, versioned edits, and full traceability.

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Orchestration**  
  Use different agents for different tasks — route, combine, and supervise with full control.

- 🔁 **Review & Approval Workflows**  
  Enforce human-in-the-loop content review before publishing. No more unreviewed AI content.

- 📄 **Chat-to-Draft Audit Trail**  
  Every draft is traceable to its prompts, contributors, and agents used.

- 📜 **Version Control**  
  Track every change, compare versions, and revert with confidence.

- 📤 **Structured Publishing Destinations**  
  Publish AI-generated content directly to Notion, Confluence, Slack, GitHub, and more — with tagging and routing logic.

- 🔒 **Enterprise-Ready**  
  Self-host in your own VPC. You own your keys, your data, your agents.

## 🧠 Why Petrel?

Most teams use AI through tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Writer — but they:
- Copy/paste content across apps
- Lack version control or approval gates
- Have no audit trail for what AI said or did
- Struggle to manage AI adoption at scale

**Petrel solves all of this.**  
It's not a chatbot. It’s the system of record and governance for AI-generated content.

Built for:
- Multi-agent workflows
- Team collaboration across roles
- Structured, auditable publishing pipelines

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Golang** backend (Gin, sqlc, Zap logger)
- **PostgreSQL** for core storage
- **OAuth 2.0** integration for agent access
- **Pluggable agent interface** (Claude, GPT, AnythingLLM, Palmyra)
- **Modular deployment** (GCP / VPC / Docker)
