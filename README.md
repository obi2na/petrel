## ✨ What is Petrel?

Petrel is a universal publishing and orchestration platform for AI-generated content. It connects your AI tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, or custom agents) to your team’s tools — Notion, Confluence, GitHub, Slack, and more — with built-in version control, approval workflows, and smart routing.

Whether you're using LLMs to write documentation, changelogs, meeting summaries, or marketing copy, Petrel helps you automate the publishing pipeline and maintain trust in what your AI produces.
