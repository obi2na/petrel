# 🐦 Petrel

**Petrel** is a universal AI-to-documentation publishing bridge.  
It connects any LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, or LangChain bots) to tools like **Notion**, **Confluence**, **Google Docs**, and more — with reliable formatting, routing, and tracking.

---

## ✨ What Petrel Does

- ✅ Accepts content generated by LLMs via API or plugin
- ✅ Publishes it to target destinations like Notion or Confluence
- ✅ Preserves markdown formatting and structure
- ✅ Handles OAuth, routing logic, and logging
- 🔜 Tracks published content via a dashboard (in development)
- 🔜 Supports multi-agent input (GPT, Claude, LangChain, etc.)
- 🔜 Enables versioning and re-publishing with diffs
- 🔜 Provides pluggable UI extensions (e.g., "Send to Notion" button in GPT or Slack)

## 🧠 Why Petrel?

LLMs are generating more and more content for work:
- Product specs
- Meeting notes
- OKRs
- Docs
- Code reviews

But most of that content still ends up being:
- ❌ Manually pasted
- ❌ Lost in chat logs
- ❌ Re-implemented in brittle automations

**Petrel solves this** by being the middleware between LLMs and your actual knowledge systems.
